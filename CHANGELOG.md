# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

> Targeting v0.3.0. **Must ship after STD v0.5.0** — this release starts
> emitting canonical keys against `/api/v1/register`, which STD v0.5.0
> introduces.

### Added
- Shared logging setup module consumed by `main.py` and all notifier
  modules. No more duplicated handler configuration across files.
- Shared retry helper. DNS notifier now retries with backoff using the
  same policy as the STD notifier.
- Common kwargs contract: every notifier module's `register()`
  receives a documented base set of kwargs (`container_name`,
  `container_id`, `docker_host`, `docker_status`, `image_name`,
  `stack_name`, `started_at`, `action`). Notifier-specific extras
  are layered on top.

### Changed
- STD notifier emits canonical key names (`host`, `group`,
  `internal_health_check_enabled`, ...) and posts to
  `/api/v1/register` instead of `/api/register`. Old STD instances
  continue to work via STD's compat shim until STD v0.6.0.
- Stack-name resolution: when `com.docker.compose.project` is missing,
  the notifier passes `stack_name=None` rather than splitting the
  container name on `_`.
- Replaced per-notifier `DNS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` and `STD_LOG_TO_STDOUT`
  env vars with a single `NOTIFIER_LOG_TO_STDOUT`. Default unchanged
  (console on). Operators who previously set `DNS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=0` or
  `STD_LOG_TO_STDOUT=0` should switch to `NOTIFIER_LOG_TO_STDOUT=0`.
- DNS notifier now raises on HTTP 4xx/5xx responses from Technitium
  and retries transient failures. Previously HTTP errors were silently
  logged as successes.
- DNS notifier's "triggered for" log line now reports the actual Docker
  action (e.g. `start`, `boot`, `refresh`) instead of the literal string
  `"event"`. Operators with log filters or alerts that grep specifically
  for `due to "event"` will need to update them.

### Removed
- Unused `trigger_reason` parameter from the DNS notifier's `register()`
  signature.
- Inline `watched_actions` literal in `main()`; the Docker event loop
  now reads from the module-level `WATCHED_DOCKER_ACTIONS` constant.

### Fixed
- Real Docker actions and synthetic actions (`boot`, `refresh`) are now
  declared as separate constants in `main.py` (`WATCHED_DOCKER_ACTIONS`
  and `SYNTHETIC_ACTIONS`) and composed into `NOTIFIER_TRIGGERS`. No
  behavior change — clarifies what the notifier subscribes to from
  Docker vs. what it injects internally.
- Misleading comment on `STD_REFRESH_SECONDS` ("60 minutes" → "60
  seconds").
